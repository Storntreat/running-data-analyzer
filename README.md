# Running Data Visualizer

This application will allow users to upload data from their runs and training sessions, using .csv files exported from smartwatches, running apps, or tracker data. It will visualize their pacing and performance trends, and AI-generate feedback or suggestions to their training and workouts to best suit their goals, based on the data provided. I am someone who finds running a hobby (I am not that fast, but have improved a lot over the years). I know there are many things to consider when training, and I often find it hard to get quick, personalized and useful insights without using multiple tools or premium options. I wanted to create a streamlined, personalized application that helps runners like me understand their performance to train smarter, not harder.

**Features**

-User can enter a target race time (e.g., 1500m in 5:30), and the app will generate ideal lap splits

-Visual feedback on pacing consistency (e.g., color-coded lap-by-lap variation)

-Automatically calculates summary metrics (average pace, distance, total time, etc.)

-Offers a basic training suggestion based on pace trends (e.g., interval vs endurance focus)
